# Under Night In-Birth II: Sys Celes x SAMMI

A Bridge Extension for [SAMMI](https://sammi.solutions). Take interactions from Under Night and turn them into stream gimmicks!

## Extension Function

This extension allows you to receive data from [TheLettuceClub's UNI2 Live Content Mod](https://github.com/TheLettuceClub/UNI2xSAMMI-Release/) in the form of Extension Triggers inside SAMMI.

## Quick Start Guide

Step 1: Download [SAMMI](https://sammi.solutions).

Step 2: Follow the various [SAMMI Onboarding Tutorials](https://sammi.solutions/docs/getting-started/step-by-step).

Step 3: Install BBCF x SAMMI as a [SAMMI Bridge](https://sammi.solutions/docs/bridge) Extension.

Step 4: Boot up BBCF while SAMMI and SAMMI Bridge are open to automatically connect.

Step 5: Make use of the various Extension Triggers generated by Under Night to drive stream gimmicks!

Step 6 (Optional): Copy the text found in the Example Deck text file to your clipboard, then import it to Sammi via the Paste Deck command. 

## Using the Mod

### Important Notes

#### Run Bridge in a regular browser instead of the embedded OBS dock for better performance.

Apparently, OBS can't handle our data. It's too much.

#### Run SAMMI at framerates >60FPS to stop button events from backing up. 

It's a SAMMI thing. This can affect commands like Motion, so if you need to animate things in OBS, I recommend the OBS Move plug-in.

### Accessing Events via Extension Triggers

| Extension Trigger | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uni2_StateUpdate`| Occurs once a frame. Contains all sorts of cool gamestate data. |
| `uni2_HitEvent` | Occurs on Hit. Contains relevant data. |
| `uni2_ComboStartEvent` | Occurs on Combo Start. Less data than uni2_HitEvent. |
| `uni2_ComboEndEvent` | Occurs on Combo End. Less data than uni2_HitEvent. |
| `uni2_RoundStartEvent` | Occurs on Round Start. |
| `uni2_RoundEndEvent` | Occurs on Round End. |
| `uni2_VorpalEvent` | Occurs on Vorpal. |

The above Extension Triggers are available for use. Add them to buttons via a button's Trigger menu. They all contain extremely relevant data within that can be accessed via the `Trigger Pull Data` command.
